            #region Common Members
            // fields - state on a class
                // fields may be marked 'readonly' meaning the value can only be set at declaration or in a constructor
            // properties - state on a class, is a getter setter wrapper of a field
                // auto-properties (most common form, also called properties) - state on a class, is a getter setter wrapper of a field, and the field is automatically hidden
                // properties can be made readonly, or write only by ommiting the setter or the getter respectively
                // properties are an example/implementation of the encapsulation OOP principle: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/tutorials/oop
            // methods - execute code blocks
            // constructors - execute when a class object is instantiated, and for parameters to be supplied that are required for the object to function properly
