            // What is a delegate? a delegate is a type-safe function pointer... Which doesn't mean much to us at this point.
            // It may be easier to understand delegates as interfaces for methods
            // If you are familiar with callbacks, you can view deleages as typed callbacks
            // Delegates allout methods to be passed as parameters

            // Funcs and Actions are also delegates
            // The only difference is that Actions do not have a return type

            // Why would we need one? I like to use delagates when was want to provide clarity to a complex method that is passed as a parameter
            // If you have a construct that you would like to provide a callback for that you don't want to hardcode but is type safe.
            // Dom events are analogous here. When the user clicks a button, fire an event with a callback (delegate) but that callback can
            // be of any method. Delegates provide identical architecture and infrastructure for this, but are type safe

            // using LinQ, we are using delegates extensively. Any method that accepts another method as an argument is a delegate
            // .Where(e => e.isActive) is .Where({delegate})
            // .Where does not know, or implement an overload for every possible type that may be passed to it, that is determined by the caller
            // by using a delegate, LinQ encapsulates the 'filtering' of the Where and allows the caller to fill in the details using a delegate

             This way of doing things is extremely beneficial under the right circumstances. 
             Think about it - why depend on an interface when all you really care about is having an implementation passed to you?
