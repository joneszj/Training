            // IDE - Integrated Development Environment
            // Visual Studio (VS) is an IDE tailored around the .Net Framework (.Net Core)
            // The .Net Framework is an ecosystem of programs and functionality developed by Microsoft
            // Web Applications, Games, Console Applications, Database Applications etc.

            // The .Net Framework can be written in C# or VB.Net, both are Object Oriented Programming languages (OOP)
            // Both compile into Intermediate Language (IL)

            // VS will organize projects for us into a solution
            // A solution may contain man projects. Projects can reference other projects but not in a circular manner

            // All C# code must be written on a class. Classes are organized in projects using a namespace as well as folders
            // C# is an OOP language, meaning our code is organized as and on objects/types

            // A type or class is simply a definition for what something is/has (state/properties) and what it does (behvior/methods)
            // An instance is when we create a type as an actual object using the 'new' keyword
            // The static keyword allows us to create state/behavior that is not tied to instances, but instead to a class
            // If the class is is not static, but has statis state/behavior, that state/behavior is shared by all instances

            // All .Net applications will call the 'static void Main' method on the Program class to start your application
            // Consider it the startup entry point

            // Starting an application is as simple as prssing F5 or clicking the green play button at the top
            // Stopping the application is a simple as pressing the red stop button once an application is running

            // A Console application is a very simple .Net application that provides for us a CLI user interface
            // We can write output, and read input
            // Console applications are extremely minimal, an so they are ideal for learning C# and fundamental .Net functionality without the overhead of learning a framework
            // (A framework is an opinionated pattern to completing certain tasks. Ex: MVC is a framework for constructing and managing a web site
            // With the Console application, we really only need to concern ourselves with input and output
            // The rest is purely learning C# and .Net base functionality

            // TODO: go over intellisense

            // We can use Console.WriteLine(string) to output text to the applicaiton
            Console.WriteLine("Hello!");
            // We can use Console.ReadKey() to get a single keypress from a user and store it into a variable
            var key = Console.ReadKey();
            // We can use Console.ReadLine() to read an entire line of input from the application and store it into a variable
            var input = Console.ReadLine();
            // There are other methods and state on the Console such as making beep sounds and setting color, but we really only need to concern ourselves with input and output for now
