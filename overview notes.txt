***fundamentals
	***data types
		types 			- a definition of something
							common types: string, char, int, double, bool
		variables 		- a block of memory that contains a value
							variables are restricted to their type in strongly typed languages like C#
							only exception would be implicit casting

	***strings
		interpolation	- $"{}"
							this is syntactic sugar for string.Format()
		concatonation	- "" + ""
							this is syntactic sugar for string.Concat()
		escape chars	- \n
		immutability	- all string are immutable, meaning they cannot change. when it appears we are modifying a string, the compiler is actually generating a new string for us
							because this can have a massive impact on memory when working with many strings, string build allows us to dynamically construct strings without the performance hit

	***control flow:
		if 				- a construct that will execute a code block if its expression if true
							else is provided and exeucted if the expression is false
							else and if can be joined for multiple expression checks
		switch * 		- a construct that will execute a code block if the value matches a case
							switches produce jump trees, that allow the switch to immediatly know which block of to to run, instead of evaluating the expresion each check like the if does

	***parsing
		parse			- will attempt to convert a base type value from a string
							will throw an exception if the conversion fails
		tryParse		- will attempt to convert a base type value from a string
							will return a bool if the conversion was successful, and out the converted value

	***conversion
		cast			- implicit/explicit conversion of similar types (cast (), as, is)
							implicit example: double x = 10; though the int 10 is not a double, it is similar to a double, and smaller, so no data is lost
							implicit example: Person x = child; where child is a type that inherits (derives from) Person, 
							explicit example: int x = (int)1.25; will cast the double as an int ant the .25 will be lost and the cast (int) is required to avoid complie-time error
		convert			- explicit conversion

	***iteration:
		while *			- a construct that will execute a code block until its expression is false
							the express may already be false, so the while may never run
							while loops are optimal when the termination expression can not be determined from the code
		doWhile	*		- same as a while, but will always execute atleast once
							while loops are optimal when the termination expression can not be determined from the code and we want the loop to run atleast once
		for/reverse for	- a construct that will execute a code block until its expression is false
							for loops accept a starting statement, an expression that when false will terminate the loop, and an opptional statement that will execute after each iteration
							for loops are optimal when the termination expression can be determined from the code

	***collections
		arrays * 		- a fixed, mutable typed collection or sequence of typed values
							- only real reason to use arrays are: performance, and an indexer
		list<t>			- a non-fixed (flexible), mutable typed collection or sequence of typed values

		***enumeration
		ienumerable		- anything that can be enumerated using an iterator
		foreach			- enumerates over an ienumerable

	***linq
		linq			- functional style of programming with ienumerables

***types
	***reference types
		class			- 
		interface		- 
		delegates		-
		dynamic			-
		string			-
		object			-
		record			-
	***value types
		struct			-
		enum			-
		tuple			-
		base value types-
