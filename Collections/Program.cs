            // Arrays require a type declaration, which indicates the type of the values in the array
            // Like variables, you cannot mix ot change the type once it is declared

            // Arrays are 0 index, meaning the first position of the array is 0, the next is 1, next is 2, and so on.
            // We can read values from an array using it index

            // since for loops provide an index, they make iterating over an array trivial

            // Arrays very are common data structures. Example, JS has an array that you can add (push) and remove (pop) on.

            // The Array class has some helpful static methods as well
