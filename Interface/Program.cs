            // you can instead pass the type that implements the interface, into a parameter that requires the interface.

            // Interfaces really shine when you want to use types that have similar behavior, but because they are distinct types, you can't use them interchangibly.

            #region My Experiece with Interfaces
            // In web development, this usually interfaces are an OOP feature that is really helpful for unit testing. Instead of creating a instance of a dependency for a test, you
            // can mock that dependance with an interface, and use the mock instead.
            // So, if you have an http api service library, instead of making the actual library, you can instead mock its signature and immediatly provide data appropriate for your tests 
            #endregion
            
            // If we examine the Array class, we can see it implements IEnumerable, so anywhere an IEnumerable is required, we can use an array
            // Same with Lists, which implement IEnumerable and ICollection

            // Another value to this is the O in SOLID. Then open/close principal. Code should be open to extension, but closed to modification.
            // Besides are switch that demonstrates getting out contrete type from our itnerface, we did a lot of 'branching' without any if statements. Very powerful

            #region Interface vs Base Class Inheritance
            // A note on interface vs base class inheritance
            // unlike base class inheritance (which we will cover later) interfaces allow us to specify and isolate exactly the state/behavior needed by various types
            // and are able to group them as needed. base class inheritance forces derived classes to inherit state/behavior that may not make sense for the derived type
            // Example: Dog, Cat and Lion are all Animals, but not all are Pets (rocks can be pets)
            // Dog Cat and Lion are Animals, Dog Cat and Rock are Pets
            // Also, a derived class can only inherit one base class
            // The benefit of a base class would be state/behavior we know will be used on all derived classes as it will be shared and can be overided by each derived type
            // For example: a sql table very often will have a Id, and audit columns (CreatedBy, CreatedOn, ModifiedBy, ModifiedOn, IsActive), a base class works well there
