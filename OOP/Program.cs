            // What is the value of OOP? OOP allows us to better organize our code as well as making it more flexible while maintaining type safety

            // What is abstraction? Modeling state and behavior of things as classes

            // What is encapsulation? Ability to hide, or protect state or behavior implementation on a class
            // What is the value of encapsulation? Hides & proetects implementation details, ease of consumer implementation, reduces human interaction error.

            // What is inheritance? A type taking upon itself (inheriting) a contract (interface) or another type (base class). 
            // What is the value of inheritance? Easily share state/behavior to derived types from base types. Simplifies working with related types by providing a consistent type interface or base class.
            // Derived types may be treated as base types. Interface inheritance provides contracts for other types where the interface is referenced instead of the actual type.

            // What is polymorphism? Overloading & Overiding.  
            // What is the value of polymorphism? Derived types can easily change base method implementation for itself.
